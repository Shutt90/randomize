# Randomize

Randomize is a password manager app that runs locally and connects to a cockroachdb database you can add. It has the ability to randomize a password and submit to the server so you generate one with random characters as and when needed.

## Installation

You would need to add a cockroachdb dsn to a .env file in the root directory, and then as long as you have Go(lang) installed, you can just run go build and use the resulting executable file.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first

This repo is currently a WIP and will be being updated as and when I have free time.
